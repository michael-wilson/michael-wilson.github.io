<p>Due to the ongoing coronavirus global pandemic Rooting 2020 has been postponed, we are now Rooting 2021, and we will be offering an exiting new format of conference by partnering with <a href="http://isrr11.org/">ISRR11</a> in Missouri, USA. We are partnering to offer full complementary programs of talks in both locations, shared online key note talks, shared online poster sessions for students and early career researchers and exclusive shared access to speakers presentations from both conferences.</p>
